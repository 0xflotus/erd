This utility takes a plain text description of entities, their attributes and 
the relationships between entities and produces a visual diagram modeling the 
description. The visualization is produced by using Dot with GraphViz. There 
are limited options for specifying color and font information. Also, `erd` can
output graphs in a variety of formats, including but not limited to: pdf, svg, 
eps, png, jpg, plain text and dot.

Here's an example of the output produced by `erd` (click on it for a larger PDF 
version):

### Installation

[erd is on hackage](http://burntsushi.net/docs/haddock/erd), so you can install 
it with cabal:

    cabal install erd

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and build from source:

    git clone git://github.com/BurntSushi/erd
    cd erd
    cabal configure
    cabal build
    # binary is now at ./dist/build/erd/erc

Usage information is available with `erd --help`.

### Quick example

Before describing the ER file, let's try making an ER diagram from a small 
example:

```bash
$ curl 'https://raw.github.com/BurntSushi/erd/master/examples/simple.er' > simple.er
$ cat simple.er
# Entities are declared in '[' ... ']'. All attributes after the entity header
# up until the end of the file (or the next entity declaration) correspond
# to this entity.
[Person]
*name
height
weight
+birth_location_id

[Location]
*id
city
state
country

# Each relationship must be between exactly two entities, which need not
# be distinct. Each entity in the relationship has exactly one of four
# possible cardinalities:
#
# Cardinality    Syntax
# 0 or 1         0
# exactly 1      1
# 0 or more      *
# 1 or more      +
Person *--1 Location
$ erd -i simple.er -o simple.pdf
```

The PDF should now contain a graph that looks like this:

### The `er` file format

The `er` format allows one to describe a relational schema in terms of its 
entities (tables), attributes (columns) and relationships between entities (0 
or 1, exactly 1, 0 or more and 1 or more).

Entities are declared inside `[` and `]`. For example, this declares the entity 
`Person` with no attributes:

```
[Person]
```

Attributes for an entity are then listed after its corresponding entity's 
declaration. Each attribute should be on its own line. The following adds the 
`name` and `height` attributes to the `Person` entity:

```
[Person]
name
height
```

Entity names and attributes may **not** contain spaces.

Any number of attributes may be declared as a primary key for its entity by 
prefixing the attribute with a `*`. Similarly, an attribute may be declared
as a foreign key by prefixing the attribute with a `+`:

```
[Person]
*name
+birth_location_id
```

An attribute may be *both* a primary key and a foreign key by prefixing the
name with a `*` and a `+` in any order. Note that primary keys are underlined
while foreign keys are italicized.

Relationships can also be declared *anywhere in an ER file*. Every relationship 
includes exactly two entities (the two entities may be the same, for 
self-relationships). Each entity in a relationship **must** have exactly one of 
four cardinalities:

```
Cardinality    Syntax
0 or 1         0
exactly 1      1
0 or more      *
1 or more      +
```

So for example, the following defines a relationship between `Person` and 
`Location` that reads "every person belongs to exactly one location":

```
Person *--1 Location
```

And here's another example that can be read as, "every platinum album has one 
or more artists, but not every artist has a platinum album":

```
Artist +--0 PlatinumAlbums
```

### Fonts, colors, labels, ...

The `er` format also has limited support for customizing the appearance of your 
ER diagram. For example, the following will show the entity with a background
color of `#ececfc` and a font size of `20`:

```
[Person] {bgcolor: "#ececfc", size: "20"}
name
height
weight
```

Which looks like:

![example of changing background 
color](http://burntsushi.net/stuff/erd/example-bgcolor.png)

Alternatively, you can specify the background color of every entity with a 
special directive at the top of the file:

```
entity {bgcolor: "#ececfc", size: "20"}

[Person]
name
height
weight

[Location]
place
```

There are three other directives: `title`, `header` and `relationship`. The 
`title` directive allows one to specify a title for the graph and provide 
options for formatting it. The `header` directive allows one to customize the 
formatting of every entity header. And similarly for `relationship`. Note that 
global options are overwritten by local options.

Here's an example depicting the first schema shown at the top of this README 
(note that this is auto-generated by 
[nfldb-write-erd](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/blob/master/scripts/nfldb-write-erd)):
